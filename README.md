# Contrail-Statistics
This analysis tool evaluates the atmospheric contrail formation conditions based on ECMWF ERA-5 Reanalysis data and helps to obtain an overview of the frequency of contrail formation over the last 10 years at different altitudes, seasons and regions. Detailed information can be found in the related work of Dischl et al., 2022.

The theory of contrail formation used in this tool is obtained from Schumann, 1996.

The calculation of the probability of contrail formation and persistence requires the air temperature as well as the relative humidity at a given pressure level. These data can be obtained from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (Hersbach et al., 2021b) under the link https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview (accessed on 28 July 2022). Data of the past 10 years covering the time period and area under investigation have to be downloaded to use this tool.
